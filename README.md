Go ahead, make my day!

Hello World, I'm Lennon,  I am an engineer, a guitarrist, a powerful gamer, a honored geek,not a billionaire even filantrope!
I work in a hospital (Yeah! an engineer in a hospital, and yes there's a lot of things to an engineer do to there), despite the initial lessons in college I still want to learn more about programming, machine-learning and data analysis. Try hard in python!
